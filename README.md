# Human-Care-Systems-TODO

- Application was built with Node, Express, JWT for authentication, and uses Vue for the front-end. 

- Data is stored in a Mlab cloud MongoDB database.

- No need for setup, the app is hosted with Heroku, the node api serves the Vue app. 


## Things I would have done differently with more time

- Store the JWT tokens in session storage so there would be persistent log in status after a reload.

- Styling, better class names, focus more on accessibility.

- Make use of the other endpoint for updating the status of a task.
